# AFM-SPM home

This repository is a base for the AFM-SPM GitHub organisation. The current objectives of the organisation are (loosely):

* Host and facilitate development of AFM/SPM software in git repositories.
* Host static forks of repositories where development is taking place elsewhere.
* Curate [lists of software](software.csv) useful for AFM/SPM.
* Host and index AFM/SPM training material.
* Provide [a place to discuss things related to the above](https://github.com/afmstats/home/discussions).

If you'd like to get involved / join please [post in the discussion](https://github.com/afmstats/home/discussions) on this repository and introduce yourself.
